## Project Overview

oam-tools (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) is the operations and maintenance toolset for Huawei CANN, providing fault diagnosis tools and performance testing and tuning tools for developers.

Main functions:
- **Fault Information Collection** (asys): Fault information collection, software and hardware information display, health check, comprehensive detection, and so on
- **AI Core Error Analysis** (msaicerr): AI Core Error problem analysis, Dump file parsing, environment checking, and so on
- **Performance Tuning** (msprof): Collect and analyze key performance indicators of AI tasks running on Ascend AI processors at various running stages
- **HCCL Performance Testing** (hccl_test): Test collective communication functionality and performance in distributed training or inference scenarios

## Build Commands

### Basic Build
```bash
# Build the project
bash build.sh

# Build with specified third-party library path
bash build.sh --cann_3rd_lib_path=${third_party_path}

# View build options
bash build.sh -h
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all test cases
bash build.sh -u

# Run tests for specific component
bash build.sh -u --component msprof
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Download third-party libraries and subrepositories (use only when network is unavailable)
python3 cmake/download_libs.py
```
