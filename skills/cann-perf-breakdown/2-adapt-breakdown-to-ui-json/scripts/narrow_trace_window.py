"""Narrow a raw Chrome-trace to the representative step's time window.

A full msprof capture covers the whole run (here ~55 s / 5.7 M events / 1 GB) while the
report only ever renders the representative step (~28 ms). Stage 3 must inline the trace
into one JS string via `JSON.stringify`, so an unnarrowed capture fails outright with
Node's `RangeError: Invalid string length` -- and even if it fit, shipping a gigabyte of
out-of-window events into a standalone HTML would be pointless.

The window comes from raw_ops.json (the representative step's own kernels), never from a
hardcoded constant, so this stays correct for any capture and any selected step.

Kept: every metadata event (`ph: M`, the process/thread names the lanes are labelled from),
and every timed event overlapping the window. Flow events (`s`/`f`) are kept as pairs --
dropping one half would leave the report drawing an arrow to nothing.
