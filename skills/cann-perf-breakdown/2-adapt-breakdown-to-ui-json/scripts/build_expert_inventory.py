"""Emit the MoE expert inventory: every declared expert, and what the capture measured.

The source declares 256 routed experts plus 1 shared expert per MoE layer. A capture almost
never contains 257 separable measurements, for two independent reasons that must not be
conflated:

1. **Expert parallelism.** With `moe_ep_size = N` only `n_routed_experts / N` experts have
   weights resident on the profiled rank. The rest execute on other ranks and appear in this
   capture only as the all-to-all that dispatches tokens to them. They are declared, not
   observed, and their time is unknown rather than zero.

2. **Kernel fusion.** The resident experts run as a single `GroupedMatmul` over a stacked
   weight tensor, with a `group_list` giving each expert's token count. One kernel, one
   duration. Per-expert time is not recoverable from it by any arithmetic the profiler
   supports — splitting the fused duration by token count would fabricate per-expert numbers
   that read as measurements.

So this emits an inventory, not a per-expert breakdown: each expert gets an identity and a
`data_state` saying precisely why it carries no metrics. `measured` belongs only to the fused
group node that actually owns a kernel. A UI can then show all 257 and be honest about which
one figure covers which experts, instead of silently showing 1 of 257 or inventing 257.

Residency is derived from the weight tensor's leading dimension in the GroupedMatmul shapes,
which is the profiled rank's own local expert count — an observation, not a config assumption.
