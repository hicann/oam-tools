"""Derive the ground-truth dataflow graph of a module's forward() from its AST.

The point of this script is that forward() *is* the dataflow graph. Asking an AI to
read the source and then attest "the residual paths are correct" throws away a free,
machine-checkable ground truth. Here we recover it deterministically:

  * every statement is reduced to (writes, reads, called submodule)
  * every read is resolved to the *last writer* of that variable
  * a merge (`a + b + c`) records its operand count and each operand's last writer
  * a variable read by 2+ later calls before being overwritten is a fork (parallel branch)
  * a variable written early and read much later is a shortcut, and the number of
    intervening calls is its overlap window

Output is `dataflow_source.json`, consumed by check_dataflow.py.

Scope and honesty: this handles the straight-line `forward()` shape that transformer
decoder layers overwhelmingly use (assignments, tuple assignments, submodule calls,
binary merges). Control flow is classified rather than uniformly rejected, because
"unsupported" is not one thing:

  * `config_gated`   the test reads only construction-time config/flags, so exactly one
                     branch runs for a given deployment. Each branch is extracted as a
                     named variant; a caller states which one its profile selected.
  * `data_dependent` the test reads a tensor//runtime value, so the graph genuinely varies
                     per token. Needs an explicit deviation declaration.
  * `unparsable`     reflection, dynamic dispatch, or a construct this reducer cannot read.

Only the latter two land in `unsupported`. Treating a quantisation-mode `if` as
unsupported made every real model report its main compute as unextractable, which is
what forced callers to hand-declare the very edges this script exists to derive.
